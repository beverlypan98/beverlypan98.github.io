          <p>Beverly Pan is a rising Junior at UC Berkeley majoring in Conservation and Resource Studies and (intended) Data Science.</p>
          <p>From a young age, she discovered her love for drawing, which propelled her to become an Illustrator for the Daily Cal.
            Along the way, she discovered that what really <i>moved</i> her was, well, motion.
            She's begun to dabble in animation, taking classes such as UCBUGG: 3D Modeling and Animation and Art for Animation.
            This set her on the path to studying how animation and visual media can be used to tell stories about the environment and communicate environmental issues.</p>
          <p>An avid lover of cute, pretty, and squishy things, Beverly hopes that one day, she'll <strike>rule the world</strike> work at a famous animation studio.</p>
